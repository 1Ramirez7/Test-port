    "text": "Introduction\nPortfolio Introduction\n\nport intro here but remove for instructions -\n\n\n\nInstructions to editing this Portfolio\nThe main goal of this instructions is focused around editing the _quarto.yml and the process of pushing to github for the site to render. If you follow the steps below on adding new files and editing the _quarto.yml your site should always render. I do not focus to much on the QMD details as that is one of the main concepts we have been working on in class. So you can edit the QMD files as you see fit, and as long as they render locally, they will be published to the site.\nThe following are instructions to edit this portfolio separated into sections. Each section is intended to show how to add and or edit different parts of the portfolio.\n\n\nUsing this template and or cloning to a new device\nStep 1\n- Go to the template, and select “Use as template.” - Name it and set it to public. - Go to Settings &gt; Pages, and configure:\n- Branch: main\n- Folder: docs\n- Hit save and watch it go live.\nStep 2\n- Create the R project for this portfolio.\n- Make an edit, render the site, and push to make sure you are connected to your portfolio:\ngit remote show origin (use in R console or RStudio)\n- Once you push to GitHub and the site is successfully built using GitHub Pages, you have successfully created your portfolio.\nStep 3\n- I have steps with videos on how to add new tabs and edit the YAML file.\n- I mostly focused on the YAML code and preparing the website. The main thing about your portfolio is to show what you are capable of. This portfolio is all set up for you to do as you want with your .qmd files, and once rendered locally, they will push to the site. So go all out.\nStep 4 (if using Python code, optional)\nIf you are not planning on using Python code, you can do this later. If you are planning on using Python code, then do the following:\n\nOpen the python.qmd file and remove the # from the ```{python} so RStudio recognizes the Python chunks.\n\nIn the instructions for the video “Working with Python…part 1,” follow and only do steps 1 to 1.9 (watch the first video). Watch the beginning of the second video until I get to the part about installing Python code, just so you understand more about environments and Python code.\n\nOnce you have done steps 1 to 1.9 and have an environment successfully loaded, run the following code to install the Python libraries in the requirements.txt file:\n\nCheck for environment loaded:\nlibrary(reticulate)\npy_config()\nLoad environment if needed:\nlibrary(reticulate)\nuse_virtualenv(\"env\", required = TRUE)\nRun to install Python libraries in requirements.txt file:\nshell(\"pip install -r requirements.txt\")\n\nRender the python.qmd file, and you should be set to run Python code within RStudio.\nWhen installing new Python libraries (edit library names as needed):\nlibrary(reticulate)\npy_install(c(\"pandas\", \"numpy\", \"matplotlib\"))\nAfter installing new Python libraries, update the requirements.txt file:\nshell(\"pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt\")\n\n\n\nAdding a New Tab\nAdding a new tab to the portfolio. I’m adding a resume.\n\nIn the _quarto.yml file add, under the navbar, and this two lines of code\ntext: \"My Resume\"\nfile: resume.qmd\nAdd/create the resume.qmd file to the root folder\n\nRender the resume.qmd file\n\nUpdate yml links\n\nBuild &gt; render website\n\nPush to GitHub and the site should be updated with your new tab.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding a Project Tab with Multiple Files\nStep 1:\nAdding a tab with a sidebar for multiple QMD files\n- Add tab code to navbar and sidebar code to _quarto.yml\nStep 2:\n- Add QMD for the main tab\n- Add a folder with QMD files for the main tab\n\n\n\n\nWorking with Python Code & Environment in R-Studio\nPart 4. Working with Python code, environment, and requirements.txt files in R-Studio\nStep 1: Check what environment is active (likely a global environment)\nlibrary(reticulate)\npy_config()\nStep 1.7: Create a virtual environment if needed (basically needed in any new device)\nlibrary(reticulate)\nvirtualenv_create(\"env\") # env can be any name you want\nStep 1.5: Load environment for the project if needed. Use the code from Step 1 to make sure the new environment is loaded. If not, use this to load the new environment. Replace env with the actual name of your environment.\nlibrary(reticulate)\nuse_virtualenv(\"env\", required = TRUE)\nStep 2: Install Python libraries\nlibrary(reticulate)\npy_install(c(\"pandas\", \"numpy\", \"matplotlib\"))\nStep 2.1: Run Python code/file and render Python files\nStep 3: Create/update the requirements.txt file\nshell(\"pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
